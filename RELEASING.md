# Releasing `@signalsafe/simulator-react`

Releases are produced by `.github/workflows/ci.yml` from a pushed `vX.Y.Z` tag. The tag must match `package.json`. The workflow also supports manual dispatch on main; use tags for the documented release sequence. Do not publish from a developer machine or move an existing release tag.

## Preparation

1. Review source, public exports, README, contract docs and CHANGELOG together. Include every release change and compatibility constraint.
2. Verify dependency availability in npm. Release simulator-core first, then simulator-react, then simulator-device. The CSS theme is independently publishable.
3. Refresh the committed Yarn lockfile for changed dependencies. No sibling `file:` or `link:` resolutions may be used for a standalone release.
4. Use Node 24 (CI also checks Node 22). Run strict typecheck, tests with coverage, build and `smoke:package` for runtime packages. For the CSS-only theme, run `smoke:package` and `publish:dry-run`. Device additionally requires `check:gallery` and `build:gallery`.
5. Inspect the packed file list and install into a clean temporary consumer. Runtime imports and TypeScript declarations must resolve without sibling repositories.
6. Commit the complete release, then push main and the matching annotated tag. Watch all tag-run checks and the Publish job. Publication uses the repository's `NPM_TOKEN` secret.

## CI gates

Core and React require checks, coverage tests, Sonar scanning and artifact smoke tests. Sonar runs on pushes and same-repository pull requests; there is no scan-label gate. Device requires checks, coverage tests and artifact smoke tests. Theme requires its file/pack smoke checks. Do not bypass failed gates.

## Consumer adoption

Verify the exact version and registry integrity after the tag workflow succeeds. Update consumers to exact registry versions, regenerate their lockfiles, and run a clean install plus consumer validation. Remove local archives only after registry installation succeeds. Keep published tags immutable; corrections use a new version.

## Node runtime compatibility

The runtime requirement is Node >=19.0.0. Build, unit-test and coverage tools use
Node 22/24 (use Node 24.16+ locally). A separate CI job installs packed artifacts
with strict engine checks and tests runtime behavior on Node 19.0.0 and 19–24.

This experiment tests updated simulator dependencies built from the pinned CI
revisions in the workflow. Before publishing, release core, then React, then
device, updating dependency versions and lockfiles to those Node 19 releases.
The existing registry releases of core/React still require Node 22.12.
